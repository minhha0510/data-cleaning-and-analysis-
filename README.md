In this project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. 
- There are approximately 1500 data points in this projects and a lot of naming mistakes. 
- You can find the TAFE exit survey DETE in the respiratory of this github.
